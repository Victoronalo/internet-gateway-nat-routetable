Project: Creating Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway and Route Table



Objective:To create an internet gateway, NAT gateway and route table for public and private subnets within an AWS vpc.



-I logged into my AWS management console.



-Navigated to the VPC services




-Clicked on create VPC tagged “vpc-igway”



-I clicked on create



-I proceeded to the create the internet gateway by clicking create



-I then attached the internet gateway to the created vpc.



-I proceeded to create  private subnet.



-I clicked on create.



-I then repeated the process for the creation of a public subnet.



-For the subnets they were linked to the vpc we created.



-The subnets are located in the same AZ.




-I now went ahead to create a public route (rt-public-igw) table for the public subnet.



- I now went ahead to create a private route table (rt-private-igw) for the private subnet




-The public route table was given access to internet by using edit route and doing the configurations




-Also the private route table was connected to the private subnet.




-The route tables were given subnet associations



-I proceeded to the NAT gateway to create a new one.



-The NAT Gateway was connected to the VPC created earlier.



The project gave me an insight into the VPC, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway and Route Table services and I have learnt a lot about.



In the process of carrying out this project there were places I got stuck but with the help of the team and the internet, I was able to scale through.
